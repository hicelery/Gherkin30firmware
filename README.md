# Gherkin30firmware
QMKfile for gherkin 30

Repo for a fairly simple gherkin 30 layout, in lieu of a standardised release.
Recommended using X-loader to side load driver into chosen at32u4 controller.

Repo contains a json with pcb layout and some initial keybindings this is a mirror of the provided json from 40percentclub.

I have included my hex file and schematic, created with qmk firmware builder. This moves to an ortholinear left-hand 'b', with held layer toggles and modifier keys roughly mirroring a standard layout.
I'm not sold on the position of the backspace, but I think this is likely the best solution - I instinctively press 'p' to backspace, but cant imagine moving 'p' to another location will be any easier to get used to.
